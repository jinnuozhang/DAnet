# LPnet

An ResNet coupled with attention block to predict the lesion propotion of rice bacterial blight disease with VIR spectrums

# Data Input

1. The form of input data is restricted as [num_samples, spectral_band+lesion_proportion].

2. An excel data is preferred or the user has to atlter the codes that are related to data input.

# Data Output

1. Logs including loss of training and validing phase.

2. All involved predicted label.

3. Attention values and attention output
